## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla javascript fetch api method

### Make it your own

- Firstly download/pull the repository and please it is recommended to use your own [openweathermap.org API](https://openweathermap.org/ api) for good performance
- to add your own api to code just copy code given below and paste it in first line of script.js file

```js
const api = {
  key: "your-api-key",
  baseUrl: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/",
  iconUrl: "http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/",
};
```

### Future development

- This is very first version as i am beginer to js the code is not very well organised, i will try to organise it in future
- Some features not works like 'lenght of day','Remaining daylight'
- Will try to add some animations on change of city or data
- Will try to add some new feature like graphs etc.

### New changes

- Added PWA to this!!:)
- You can use this like natvie app on your phone just install it by clicking add to homeScreen or it will popup
- Now code is not very well but organised
